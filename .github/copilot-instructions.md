This project is a student-oriented website for AAU Nightlife Ekpoma, focused on events promotion and job opportunities. The frontend uses React (Vite), and the backend will use Node.js/Express. Prioritize mobile-friendly, SEO-optimized, and easy-to-navigate code. All sections (Home, Events, Jobs, Contact) should be clearly separated and visually appealing.
